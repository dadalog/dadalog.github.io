## 👋 Hello, World

This is my very first post. I want to keep this blog going as long and sustainably as possible while I'm studying abroad.

***

## 🧐 Why started blogging? 

I found myself quite lonely, and feeling vulnerable when I don't create anything—like writing, which is a source of creation itself, whether it’s for an academic paper or just diarying. Or exercising, which is, in its own way, a very active form of being.
At first, I thought of writing in my mother tongue, but maybe because I'm in a foreign country, I found myself starting to write in English very naturally. It will be fun to see how my writing skills develop as time goes on! (Although most of the parts will probably be checked by ChatGPT 😜) It would be awesome if, by the end of this blog, I could write a novel :)

## What topics will be covered?
- Study
    - Research
        - Papers I found interesting — ideally all the papers I read 🤭
        - Basic Knoweldge in ML
    - Coding
        - Errors I often encounter while running experiments — especially in Python and PyTorch
        - Prep for coding interviews
    - Personal
        - Random scribbles about anything :)

## End
Let’s see where this goes 🙂
